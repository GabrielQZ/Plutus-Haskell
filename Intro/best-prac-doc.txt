Common/Best practices
It is common practice to add ' to the end of a funciton name when defining a new version of a function with slight variation

to reduce nested () it is common to use $ to indicate the start of a () block

Tuples vs Lists

tuples have a set number of elements, list do not
tuples act more like Java arrays, list are more like the Linked-List class in Java
tuples can have elements of multiple types, list are locked to one type
tuple syntax: () 
list syntax: []

you can create a list of tuples but each tuple must be contructed in the same way

valid: [("str1", 1), ("str2", 2)]

invalid: [("str3", 3), (4, "str4")]
-- this is expecting the second tuple to be structured (String, Integer) and the second one breaks this pattern

----------------------------------------------------------
Tuples vs Triples 
Triples act the same as a tuple but contain 3 elements

the fst & snd function only works on tuples
